# Install Koharu

## Download a release build

Download the latest release from the [Koharu releases page](https://github.com/mayocream/koharu/releases/latest).

Koharu provides prebuilt binaries for:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux

If your platform is not covered by a release build, use [Build From Source](build-from-source.md).

## What gets installed locally

Koharu is a local-first application. In practice, the desktop binary is only part of the install footprint. The first real run also creates a per-user local data directory for:

- runtime libraries used by llama.cpp and GPU backends
- downloaded vision and OCR models
- optional local translation models you select later

Koharu keeps its own files under a `Koharu` app-data root and stores model weights separately from the application binary.

## First launch expectations

On first run, Koharu may:

- extract or download runtime libraries required by the local inference stack
- download the default vision and OCR models used by detection, segmentation, OCR, inpainting, and font estimation
- wait to download local translation LLMs until you actually select them in Settings

This is normal and can take a while depending on your connection and hardware.

If you want to prefetch those runtime dependencies ahead of time, run Koharu once with `--download`. That path initializes the runtime packages and default vision stack, then exits without opening the GUI.

## GPU acceleration notes

Koharu supports:

- CUDA on supported NVIDIA GPUs
- Metal on Apple Silicon Macs
- Vulkan on Windows and Linux for OCR and LLM inference
- CPU fallback on all platforms

Some practical details matter:

- detection and inpainting benefit most from CUDA or Metal
- Vulkan is mainly the fallback GPU path for OCR and local LLM inference
- if Koharu cannot verify that your NVIDIA driver supports CUDA 13.0 or newer, it falls back to CPU

On CUDA-capable systems, Koharu bundles and initializes the runtime pieces it needs instead of requiring you to configure every library path manually.

!!! note

    Keep your NVIDIA driver up to date. Koharu requires a driver supporting CUDA 13.0 or newer for vision GPU acceleration, and CUDA 13.1+ on Windows for the local LLM CUDA path. If the driver is too old, Koharu falls back to CPU.

## After installation

Once Koharu launches successfully, the next decisions are usually:

- desktop GUI vs headless mode
- local translation model vs remote provider
- rendered export vs layered PSD export

See:

- [Run GUI and Headless Modes](run-gui-and-headless.md)
- [Models and Providers](../explanation/models-and-providers.md)
- [Export Pages and Manage Projects](export-and-manage-projects.md)
